## Exercise 1

js files could not be loaded (304 error)

## Exercise 2

4 js files were loaded
It takes on average 3 ms to load an es6 module
85 ms
It loaded api.js and index.js sequentially, but loaded table.js and http.js in parallel

## Exercise 3

## Exercise 4
Because one dependency listed in package.json can require many modules in order to work

## Exercise 5
Those bugs have been fixed in release 2.9.4

## Exercise 6
Webpack combines our different modules into static assets. It will help us because the browser won't have to load each module separately.

## Exercise 8
Yes because it only loaded one file (the dist/index.js) instead of 6

## Exercise 9
In Production mode, the output is a single-line file
From what I've understood, in Dev mode, the output uses the `eval()` function to create (for each file) a separate source file in the browser DevTools

## Exercise 10
Internet Explorer failed to run the bundled app because it is not compatible with ES6

## Exercise 11
No because we also need the corresponding polyfills

## Exercise 13
